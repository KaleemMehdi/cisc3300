1. HTML is a markup language that establishes how text and images are structured/presented digitally. It specifies how different elements are formatted and displayed on webpages.
2. There are a bunch of images and also a video. There are also many links that are visually presented as words. There are different sections that have subheadings in them. Every section has a subheading,image, and link which makes it clear to the user how to navigate the Fordham website.      
3. An HTML element is made up of a start and end tag with the content in between them. HTML elements represent different types of content that are displayed on a webpage. HTML tags are containers that enclose the content. The content can be displayed differently depending on which tags are used. HTML atributes provide us with additional info about an element's contents. Attributes have both a name and a value.  
4. When an element has semantic meaning, it means that their meaning is conveyed by their element type. When an element has structural meaning, it means that their meaning is not conveyed by their element type but the element will still visually affect the structure of a webpage.   
5. The default behavior when submitting a HTML form is that the info that is inputted by the user is added to the end of the webpage's URL.
