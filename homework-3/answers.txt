1. Flexbox and CSS Grid are both CSS layout systems. Flexbox is one-dimensional, whereas CSS Grid is two-dimensional. CSS Grid is more useful for creating more complex layouts (because you work with rows and columns). Flexbox is more useful for creating simpler layouts because you're only working with one dimension. 
2. Responsive design creates changes to how a website looks, depending on the device's screen size and orientation. We implement responsive design with the help of CSS Media queries, which apply styles based on the characteristics of the browser and how those characteristics are changed. For example, media queries commonly target particular viewport ranges and apply custom styles depending on the range.
