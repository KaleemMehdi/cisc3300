1. Hoisting occurs during the preparation phase each time a script enters a new execution context. Hoisting is when variables, functions, and arguments are created before they are executed. All of the variables and functions are "hoisted" to the top of the execution context, and are prepared before they are executed. For each execution context, the scope is the current execution context's variables object, plus the variables object for each parent execution context. This is called closures.
2. PHP is an interpreted programming language that we use to build webpages. Server side languages process user input and interact with other servers.
3. PHP and JS are both dynamic and weakly typed. In PHP, variables start with a '$' sign followed by the variable name. In JS, variables are declared using 'var', 'let', or 'const'. In JS, arrays are ordered, zero-indexed lists that can hold mixed data types. In PHP, arrays can be both indexed and associative, and can also hold mixed data types.
4. We pick PHP over another server side scripting language like Python or Node because PHP syntax is super simple, making it easier to learn especially for beginners who are making HTML. PHP is also very popular in web development, and it has a long history which means that it's easier to learn it and troubleshoot.
5. echo and var_dump can both be used to output information. echo outputs one or more expressions, whereas var_dump dumps information about one or more variables. The information that is dumped holds the types and values of the variables, meaning that non primitive values can be printed out.
