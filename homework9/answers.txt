1. Relationships in SQL are the established associations between two or more tables. Joins allow you to request data from more than one table.
2. The join keyword denotes the relationship between the primary key of the first table and the foreign key of the second table.
3. A PDO (PHP Data Object) is a built in class that comes packaged with PHP to make it easy for us to interact with databases, and it represents and manages the connection to the database. A DSN (Data Source Name) is a string that contains information about our connection to the database.
4. Prepared statements are parameterized and reusable SQL queries that force the developer to write the SQL command and the user-provided data separately. We need prepared statements because they help prevent SQL injection attacks.
5. An .env file stores key value pairs of all the environment variables used in an application, and usually contains sensitive information that should not be shared or exposed.
